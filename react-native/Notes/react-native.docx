View is like div or span in HTML




Use props: Your own components can also use props.
 This lets you make a single component that is used in many different places in your app,
  with slightly different properties in each place. Just refer to this.props in your render function.     

With props and the basic Text, Image and View components, you can build a wide
variety of static screens.





Use state: There are two types of data that control a component: props and state.
 props are set by the parent and they are fixed throughout the lifetime of a component.
 For data that is going to change, we have to use state.
 you should initialize state in the constructor, and then call setState when you want to change it.

 We can use a state container like Redux and Mobx to control your data flow.





 Use style: The style names and values usually match how CSS works on the web,
 except the names are written using camel casing.

 Example: (1)

 const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  bigblue: {
    color: 'blue',
    fontWeight: 'bold',
    fontSize: 30,
  },
  red: {
    color: 'red',
  },
});

<Text style={styles.bigblue}>just bigblue</Text>

Example (2)-- REMEMBER TWO CURLY BRACES
 <View style={{width: 50, height: 50, backgroundColor: 'powderblue'}} />







 Manage Height and Width:
 Fixed Dimension:   <View style={{width: 50, height: 50, backgroundColor: 'powderblue'}} />



 Flex Dimensions:
 Normally you will use flex: 1 to fill all available space.
 A component can only expand to fill available space if its parent has dimensions greater than 0.
  If a parent does not have either a fixed width and height or flex,
   the parent will have dimensions of 0 and the flex children will not be visible.

Example for Flex dimensions:
<View style={{flex: 1}}>
        <View style={{flex: 1, backgroundColor: 'powderblue'}} />
        <View style={{flex: 2, backgroundColor: 'skyblue'}} />
        <View style={{flex: 3, backgroundColor: 'steelblue'}} />
      </View>








Layout with Flexbox
We use a combination of flexDirection, alignItems, and justifyContent to achiieve the right layout.

flexDirection: default to column(vertically)   horizontally(row)

justifyContent: determine the distribution of children along the primary axis.
Available options are flex-start, center, flex-end, space-around, space-between and space-evenly.

alignItems: determine the alignment of children along the secondary axis.
Available options are flex-start, center, flex-end, and stretch.

For stretch to have an effect, children must not have a fixed dimension along the secondary axis.
 In the following example, setting alignItems: stretch does nothing until the width: 50 is removed from the children.

Example:
export default class AlignItemsBasics extends Component {
  render() {
    return (
      // Try setting `alignItems` to 'flex-start'
      // Try setting `justifyContent` to `flex-end`.
      // Try setting `flexDirection` to `row`.
      <View style={{
        flex: 1,
        flexDirection: 'column',
        justifyContent: 'center',
        alignItems: 'center',
      }}>
        <View style={{width: 50, height: 50, backgroundColor: 'powderblue'}} />
        <View style={{width: 50, height: 50, backgroundColor: 'skyblue'}} />
        <View style={{width: 50, height: 50, backgroundColor: 'steelblue'}} />
      </View>
    );
  }
};








Handling Text input:
TextInput is a basic component that allows the user to enter text.
 It has an onChangeText prop that takes a function to be called every time the text changed,
 and an onSubmitEditing prop that takes a function to be called when the text is submitted.


 export default class PizzaTranslator extends Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {text: ''};
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <View style={{padding: 10}}>
        <TextInput
          style={{height: 40}}
          placeholder="Type here to translate!"
          onChangeText={(text) => this.setState({text})}
        />
        <Text style={{padding: 10, fontSize: 42}}>
          {this.state.text.split(' ').map((word) => word && 'üçï').join(' ')}
        </Text>
      </View>
    );
  }
}







Handling touches
Display a simple button:  This will render a blue label on iOS, and a blue rounded rectangle with white text on Android. 
<Button
  onPress={() => {
    Alert.alert('You tapped the button!');
  }}
  title="Press Me"
/>
