The number of pixels that fit into an inch is referred to as pixel density.
 High-density screens have more pixels per inch than low-density ones.
  As a result, UI elements of the same pixel dimensions appear larger on low-density screens,
   and smaller on high-density screens.

To calculate screen density, you can use this equation:
Screen density = Screen width (or height) in pixels / Screen width (or height) in inches


Density independence refers to the uniform display of UI elements on screens with different densities.

Density-independent pixels, written as dp (pronounced “dips”), 
are flexible units that scale to have uniform dimensions on any screen. 
Material UIs use density-independent pixels to display elements consistently on 
screens with different densities.
